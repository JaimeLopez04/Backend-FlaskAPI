### Spotify Clone API

This repository contains an API for a Spotify clone, allowing developers to build music streaming applications similar to Spotify. The API provides a wide range of functionalities and features that mimic the core functionality of Spotify, including:

#### Key Features:
- **User Authentication**: Easily implement secure user authentication and authorization to manage user accounts and access to their personalized music content.
- **Music Playback**: Integrate music playback capabilities, enabling users to play, pause, skip, and control the volume of tracks in the application.
- **Playlist Management**: Enable users to create, edit, and delete playlists, as well as add and remove tracks from their playlists.
- **Search**: Implement a powerful search functionality, allowing users to search for songs, artists, albums, and playlists based on various criteria.
- **Recommendations**: Utilize advanced algorithms to provide personalized music recommendations based on user preferences and listening history.
- **Social Features**: Implement social features such as following other users, sharing playlists, and discovering new music based on what friends are listening to.

This API is built with [insert programming language/framework] and follows industry best practices to ensure scalability, performance, and security. It provides a solid foundation for developers to create their own music streaming applications with a familiar Spotify-like experience.

Please note that this API does not include the actual music content but focuses on the backend functionality needed to power a Spotify-like application.

### Getting Started

To start the project, follow these commands:

1. Clone or download this repository:
   To clone :
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/JaimeLopez04/Backend-FlaskAPI
   ```

2. Change the directory to Backend-FlaskAPI:
    ```
    cd Backend-FlaskAPI
    ```

3. Activate virtualenv or create if no exist (Only execute the first command if virtualenv is not install in your computer)
     ```
     pip install virtualenv

     virtualenv venv
     
     . \venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies. Run the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Ensure that you have Python and pip installed on your system. The requirements.txt file contains the necessary dependencies and their versions.

5. Start the Flask server:
    ```
    flask run
    ```

Now, you should have the Spotify Clone API up and running. You can make requests to the API endpoints to test the functionality or integrate it with your frontend application.

Contributions to this open-source project are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests, report issues, and collaborate with other developers to enhance the features and performance of this Spotify Clone API.
